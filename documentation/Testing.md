## User Testing

 - Mentor - Nareneder Singh: Hi Eddie, I saw the new remake, and I wanna say, "I loved it", nicely done, simple as that.
     I was hoping that you'll be able to understand the core idea, which I was trying to sell you and seems like it was sold nicely. 

 - Kirsten Robertson (partner of developer): I find the site very easy to navigate and understand. It does what its meant to.

 - Steven Mahwinney (Logo designer and friend): I love the cool vibe of the site. I know staright away im on a guitar site and i 
   feel nice when navigating the pages.

## Responsive Design Testing

 - I tested the site on all screen sizes with my home devices and through the developer tools.
 - I used media queries to makin some elements reponsive and fit nicely when screen sizes change.
