    should be a pleasant journey and something that should be enjoyed. Potential clients will be able to feel like playing 
    guitar is achievable and not tedious and mundane.

 ### Colours and Typography:
    
  - I decided on an off white for the font colouring as i found it added to the laid back 
    and cool feel of the site.

  - I used "Turret Road" with sans-serif as a fall back for my font-family. I found this style
    to suit the vibe if the site.
