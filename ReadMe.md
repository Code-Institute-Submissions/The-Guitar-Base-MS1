# The Guitar Base

    The Guitar Base is a site designed to make guitar lessons look easy and doable. We believe that learning guitar 
    should be a pleasant journey and something that should be enjoyed. Potential clients will be able to feel like playing 
    guitar is achievable and not tedious and mundane.

    Once people have browsed over the pages and read our info the will then be able to book a lesson of their choosing
    by filling in the booking form which all the links will guide them too.

 ### Colours and Typography:
    
  - I decided on an off white for the font colouring as i found it added to the laid back 
    and cool feel of the site.

  - I used "Turret Road" with sans-serif as a fall back for my font-family. I found this style
    to suit the vibe if the site.
